Hi, I am Manos Platakis.

I currently am an Undergraduate Student of BSc in Computer Science at the University of Crete, since September 2020.
Finishing my first year of studies, I had the opportunity to get introduced to and work as a part-time beta tester in ORamaVR company.
I am currently doing my internship in ORamaVR as a Content Designer.
My future goals involve getting my bachelor degree in Greece and then completing my post-graduate studies in one of the leading Universities abroad.
